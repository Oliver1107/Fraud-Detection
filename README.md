# Fraud-Detection
In this project, I explored and modeled a synthetic e-commerce fraud detection dataset inspired by global transaction anomalies observed in Istanbul, Berlin, New York, London, and Paris.
The dataset simulates realistic fraud patterns such as:
- Small “test” transactions (e.g., $1 purchases at midnight)
- Long-distance shipping for low-value items
- Reuse of promo codes from newly created accounts

This project demonstrates how to analyze, engineer features, and build a predictive model to classify fraudulent transactions while handling the challenges of class imbalance and noisy behavior data.
